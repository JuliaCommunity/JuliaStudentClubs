[Julia Student Clubs](url) are created to foster the learning of Julia Programming Language amongst interested students at all grade levels. If you are a [Julia Student Club Member](url) or a [Julia Student Club Leader](url) then, below is a list of topics and related resources which can be taken up for exploration at your Clubs. This is just an basic list of topics, you are free to discuss other topics related to Julia at your Club! Enjoy this journey of learning and exploring Julia!
